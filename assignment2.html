            <p>Until recently, values and benefits from protected areas have often been taken for granted and underestimated. This book entitled National Park: Management and Conservation demonstrates that there are deep necessities in how the wider scientific, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural values that these natural ecosystems provide should increasingly be recognized. The book highlights various approaches for managing and conserving protected areas to respond to some pressing global challenges today such as climate change, demand for food and energy, over exploitation, and habitat change. For this purpose, the book is published to address these issues and divided into five main sections: (1) protected area management, (2) fish and wildlife conservation, (3) biodiversity conservation, (4) ecotourism and recreation, and (5) local community participation.</p>    
            <p>The first section concentrates on challenges, constraints, and the way forward in managing protected areas with special references to Croatia, Austria, and the Czech Republic which include some pertinent issues related to transboundary cooperation. It outlines how mutual cooperation between countries can be achieved to share common responsibility in protected area management. An establishment and implementation of protected area management plan and determination of wildlife population in protected areas are highlighted in the second section of the book based on the case studies conducted in Japan and Ethiopia, respectively. Meanwhile, in Brazil, biomarkers were used to assess the exposure to environmental stress in fish population. The third section of the book outlines a progress and historical perspective over hundred years of national parks’ existence in Spain since 1918. The establishment of protected areas has promoted toward more sustainable use of forest resources through biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development. The second chapter of this section highlights the important roles of forest biomass estimated from three forest types in Malaysia (i.e., lowland dipterocarp, hill dipterocarp, and riparian forests) in sequestering carbon as climate change mitigation. The fourth section discusses the important roles of interpretation as part of management tools for recreation in the national parks of South Africa. The next chapter discusses the growing trend of ecotourism in national parks and how it impacts the natural environment. The final section of the chapter presents the opportunities and constraints for local community involvement in protected area management in Turkey. An assessment and measurement methods to evaluate the effectiveness of stakeholder participatory process are also highlighted.</p>
            <p>It can be summarized that the book discusses multifaceted issues pertaining the management and conservation of national parks and protected areas. The proceeding section of this introductory chapter is written on the premise that nature conservation remains the primary aim of protected areas. The chapter demonstrates that there is a profound link between the roles of protected areas and biodiversity conservation based on case studies in Malaysia. While many of protected areas are established worldwide for the conservation of particular species of interest, yet their benefits may be extended to conservation of entire biodiversity pools. In addition, biodiversity conservation, i.e., species, genetic diversity within species, and of habitats, underpins the ecosystem function of protected areas which contribute to many practical and utilitarian benefits.</p>

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Agriculture and Soil Biodiversity</h1><hr>
            <p>
                Our agricultural activities exert an important influence on the soil biota, their activities and diversity (see top figure right; table). Clearing forested or grassland for cultivation drastically affects the soil environment and hence reduces the number and species of soil organisms. The reduction of quantity and quality of plant residues and the number of higher plants species leads to a reduction in the range of habitats and foods for soil organisms.
                Different types of agricultural practices and systems affect the soil biota in different ways and the response (see bottom figure right) may be either positive or negative depending on which part of the soil the biota, e.g. fungal or bacterial, is affected. For example, organisms which are sensitive to pH will be affected by the addition of lime; the bacterial: fungal ratio will be affected by the addition of fertilizers and manures which alter the C:N ratio as will the effects of tillage. Tilling the soil will reduce the number of fungal hyphens, because soil aggregates, which are held together by these hyphens, are broken down.
                The consequences of agricultural practices on soil biota may be direct and far reaching. Organisms which are of benefit to agriculture and which may be affected include those responsible for:

            </ul>
            <p>
                Agricultural practices that use high amounts of external-inputs, such as inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, and other amendments, can overcome specific soil constraints to crop production. These practices have led to considerable increases in overall food production in Europe, Asia and the Americas. However, especially in the most intensively managed systems, this has resulted in continuous environmental degradation, particularly of soil, vegetation and water resources, such as in the state of Haryana in India. Soil organic matter levels are declining and the use of chemical inputs is intensifying (Singh, 2000).
                Any misuse of high external inputs for crop production has far reaching effects, which include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deterioration of soil quality and reduction in agricultural productivity due to nutrient depletion, organic matter losses, erosion and compaction.</li>
                <li>Pollution of soil and water through the over use of fertilizers and the improper use and disposal of animal wastes.</li>
                <li>Increased incidence of human and ecosystem health problems due to the indiscriminate use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers.</li>
                <li>Loss of biodiversity due to the use of reduced number of species being cultivated for commercial purposes.</li>
                <li>Loss of adaptability traits when species that grow under specific local environmental conditions become extinct.</li>
                <li>Loss of beneficial crop-associated biodiversity that provides ecosystem services such as pollination, nutrient cycling and regulation of pest and disease outbreaks.</li>
                <li>Soil salinisation, depletion of freshwater resources and reduction of water quality due to unsustainable irrigation practices throughout the world.</li>
                <li>Disturbance of soil physicochemical and biological processes as a result of intensive tillage and slash and burning.</li>

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Dryland and Land Degradation</h1><hr>
                <p>
                Drylands are places of water scarcity, where rainfall may be limited or may only be abundant for a short period. They experience high mean temperatures, leading to high rates of water loss to evaporation and transpiration. Drylands are also characterised by extremely high levels of climatic uncertainty, and many areas can experience varying amounts of annual precipitation for several years.

                </div>
                <p>Drylands are found on all continents, and include grasslands, savannahs, shrublands and woodlands. They are most common in Africa and Asia – for example, in the Sahel region in Africa and almost all of the Middle East. Drylands cover over 40% of the earth's land surface, provide 44% of the world’s cultivated systems and 50% of the world’s livestock, and are home to more than two billion people.</p>
                <p>Drylands are extremely vulnerable to climatic variations, and damaging human activities such as deforestation, overgrazing and unsustainable agricultural practices. The consequences of these include soil erosion, the loss of soil nutrients, changes to the amount of salt in the soil, and disruptions to the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles – collectively known as land degradation.</p>
                <p>Land degradation leads to the reduction or loss of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of land. In drylands, land degradation is known as desertification. It is estimated that 25-35% of drylands are already degraded, with over 250 million people directly affected and about one billion people in over one hundred countries at risk.</p>

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Climate Change</h1><hr>
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
                    Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
                    The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.</p>
                    <div style="width: 50%;float: right;">
                        <img src="C:\Users\Joy Gandhi\Documents\Webinterfaceassignment1.html\Blog-Images2@2x.jpg" alt="This is a logo" style="width: 90%;height: 10%;margin-left: 1%;margin-right: 5%;">
                    </div>
                <p>
                    Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.The average temperature of the Earth’s surface is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.

                <p>
                    The illegal wildlife trade knows no borders. International crime networks often use complicated ever-changing transit routes to take advantage of weak governance and inadequate surveillance. In many cases its impact is exacerbated by habitat loss and other pressures. However, if actions and funds are well focused there are significant opportunities for conservation success along known illegal wildlife trade pathways.

                <p>
                    Growing demand for ivory, particularly from Asia, has led to a surge in African elephant poaching in recent years. Tens of thousands of elephants are killed annually to meet the demand for ivory products, putting elephant populations — especially in central and eastern Africa— at considerable risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There can also be far-reaching security implications from organised illegal wildlife trade. It is run by criminal networks with a wide, international reach. Some also traffic illegal drugs, arms and even people. Poaching and wildlife trafficking also undermines sustainable development and community livelihoods and safety, posing related challenges around law enforcement, poverty and economic opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Local communities are often vulnerable to the impacts of poaching as they can be either threatened by the illegal activity or tempted by poverty to become part of it. WWF and partners work with local communities to provide alternative incomes through, for example, tourism opportunities and to assist them to become guardians of the wildlife.It's one thing to ban or limit the trade in a particular species, but another to effectively enforce such regulations, especially in developing countries. WWF helps countries to comply with CITES commitments through training workshops and the development and effective implementation of regulations.

                    Animal trafficking is in the top five most lucrative global crime enterprises. It is estimated that this trade accrues between $7-20 billion a year (Goyenechea & Indenbaum, 2015). In total, it is estimated that over 350 million animals are bought and sold on the black market each year (Carrington, 2013). There are many reasons why animal trafficking is still so prevalent, but one of the largest reasons is poverty. This industry provides some stability, and due to the high demand for these luxury goods, the hunters are expected to be well compensated. Another aspect that allows this industry to continue is the demand for specific “animal-based” products. The people who are supplying poachers with income are looking to purchase luxury items like animal skins, ivory, or even medicine obtained from certain animals. As mentioned earlier, over 350 million animals are estimated to be trafficked per year globally, but of that number, we decided the three most interesting animal species to research were the tiger, elephant, and rhino. Each of these species is sought after for their own specific product or attribute: tigers being sold for their pelts or as exotic pets, elephants being killed for their ivory or being sold as pets, and rhinos being killed for their ivory and sold as pets. All three of these species are constantly in danger in their natural environments due to poachers, and the decline in their populations severely affects not only them but every animal in their ecosystem. Locationally, these animals reside mainly in Southeast Asia, China, and Mexico.

                    Mining poses serious and highly specific threats to biodiversity. However, mining can also be a means for financing alternative livelihood paths that, over the long-term, may prevent biodiversity loss. Complex and controversial issues associated with mining and biodiversity conservation are often simplified within a narrow frame oriented towards the negative impacts of mining at the site of extraction, rather than posed as a series of challenges for the conservation science community to embrace. Here, we synthesize core issues that, if better understood, may ensure coexistence between mining and conservation agendas. We illustrate how mining impacts biodiversity through diverse pathways and across spatial scales. We argue that traditional, site-based conservation approaches will have limited effect in preventing biodiversity loss against an increasing mining footprint, but opportunities to improve outcomes (e.g. through long-term strategic assessment and planning) do exist. While future mineral supply is uncertain, projections suggest demand will grow for many metals and shift mining operations towards more dispersed and biodiverse areas. Initiating dialogue between mining companies, policy-makers and conservation organizations is urgent, given the suite of international agendas simultaneously requiring more minerals but less biodiversity loss.

                <p>
                    Sudden shifts in environmental priorities cause distrust among conservation organizations because effective biodiversity agendas require long-term commitments.We argue that an improved understanding of the links between mining and biodiversity will contribute towards achieving global conservation goals and lay an essential platform for effective engagement and collaboration.

                    Roads have a major impact on Amazon deforestation. However, the effects of the rapidly growing network of illegal or unofficial roads in the Amazon are usually not considered. We assessed relationships between past deforestation and existing networks of highways, navigable rivers, and all other roads, including more than 190,000 km of unofficial roads. We found that deforestation was much higher near roads and rivers than elsewhere in the Amazon; nearly 95% of all deforestation occurred within 5.5 km of roads or 1 km of rivers. Protected areas near roads and rivers had much lower deforestation (10.9%) than did unprotected areas near roads and rivers (43.6%). If one assumes that existing protected areas halt deforestation, then we estimate that 39,462 km2 of expected forest clearing would have been avoided. However, if one assumes that protected areas merely displace deforestation to other locations, then we estimate that 34,501 km2 of expected clearing would have been displaced elsewhere. We conclude that proximity to transportation networks, particularly the rapidly growing unofficial road network, is a major proximate driver of deforestation in Amazonia and that protected areas are having a strong mitigating effect on that risk.

                <p>
                    In addition to major road networks, a network of unofficial roads, built without any government oversight or incentives, is rapidly growing in the Amazon region (Arima et al., 2005, Asner et al., 2006, Brandão and Souza, 2006, Perz et al., 2007). These roads are generally built to open up forests to exploitative activities such as logging but subsequently lead to new colonization (Veríssimo et al., 1995), forest fragmentation (Arima et al., 2008), ecological degradation (Laurance et al., 2006), and increased fire risk (Cochrane, 2003, Nepstad et al., 2001). Very high annual growth rates (exceeding 40 km of new roads per 10,000 km2 of area) have been reported in some regions (Brandão and Souza, 2006). Navigable rivers provide another potential mode of access to forested regions and further promote deforestation and logging (Peres and Terborgh, 1995, Veríssimo et al., 1998), although they are largely left out of region-wide analyses of deforestation drivers.

                <p>
                    Disaster, any natural or human-generated calamitous event that produces great loss of human life or destruction of the natural environment, private property, or public infrastructure. A disaster may be relatively sudden, such as an earthquake or an oil spill, or it may unfold over a longer period, such as the effects of an ongoing pandemic or climatic disruption. Severe droughts, wildfires, floods, landslides, and volcanic eruptions are often considered examples of natural disasters. Large industrial accidents, building collapses, high-rise fires, airliner crashes, ship sinkings, and acts of terrorism are frequently classified as human-caused disasters. The term may also be used to describe other events, such as the displacement of large populations as a result of war.

                    The frequency of an event and the magnitude of its impact influence whether an event is regarded as a disaster. Events with a low frequency of occurrence and a high magnitude of impact (in terms of large economic and human losses)—such as the death and damage caused by a famine, severe earthquake, flood, or tropical cyclone, or the harm produced by the large release of poison gas by a chemical plant—are usually declared disasters by government authorities. Events with a high frequency of occurrence and a low magnitude of impact—such as a seasonal disease outbreak, the absence of rain during the dry season, or the annual number of deaths due to automobile accidents—might be regarded as normal or routine events. The determination of what levels are high and what levels are low, however, can be subjective and may vary by culture, prior history with the type of event, and ability to respond to the event. Thus, disasters of similar characteristics might be viewed differently in different settings (see also disaster epidemiology).

                    For the purpose of the scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (para. 15), the following terms are also considered:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Small-scale disaster: a type of disaster only affecting local communities which require assistance beyond the affected community.</li>
                    <li>Large-scale disaster: a type of disaster affecting a society which requires national or international assistance.</li>
                    <li>Frequent and infrequent disasters: depend on the probability of occurrence and the return period of a given hazard and its impacts. The impact of frequent disasters could be cumulative, or become chronic for a community or a society.</li>
                    <li>A slow-onset disaster is defined as one that emerges gradually over time. Slow-onset disasters could be associated with, e.g., drought, desertification, sea-level rise, epidemic disease.</li>
                    <li>A sudden-onset disaster is one triggered by a hazardous event that emerges quickly or unexpectedly. </li>
                    <li> Sudden-onset disasters could be associated with, e.g., earthquake, volcanic eruption, flash flood, chemical explosion, critical infrastructure failure, transport accident.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Only one locomotive pulled the 19 cars. Though the locomotive could effectively move the heavy load, the train’s engineer reportedly had warned French officials that the train would likely be unable to brake fully on hills. As the train moved out of a tunnel, it began descending a steep hill. The train lost control as it neared the bottom of the hill, where it ran over a bridge and derailed. The train cars were made mostly of wood and immediately began to burn. Many of the hundreds of victims were unidentifiable. The engineer survived the accident.
